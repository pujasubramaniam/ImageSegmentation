# ImageSegmentation
Image Segmentation Project completed in R. Download JPG files to run.

The utilization of imagesegmentation can be seen in a variety of industries – medical diagnosis,autonomous driving, and face recognition. Image pixels can be interpretedas nodes of a graph with edges connecting neighboring pixels; this approach toviewing images allows us to use different network optimization methods toconduct image analysis. In this project, I utilize these methods to do imagesegmentation to split an image into the foreground and background. This can becompleted several ways; I include 2 in my project. The first is naïvethreshholding, where the parameter choices are set somewhat arbitrarily. Theother is using the min-cut/max-flow approach, where we compute matrices todifferentiate between foreground and background pixels, as well as the weightson the edges of connecting node pairs.
